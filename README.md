# <Code-Quiz>

## Description

I created this project as a short quiz to test the user's knowledge of JavaScript. It allows the user to answer multiple choice questions about JavaScript, while being timed. The quiz allows the user to store their high score, so they can compete against themselves or their coding friends!

## Installation

This is a web-based application with no instalation required. 

## Usage

The home page provides the user with the instuctions for the quiz. When the user understands the rules, thye hit "start quiz" to begin the quiz. The user than answers multiple choice question about JavaScript, and is given a final score. The user has the opportunity to save their high score with their initials, so they can compare their score against their own re-attempts, or against their friends. 

The quiz can be accessed here: https://llyruss.github.io/Code-Quiz/
